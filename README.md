### Welcome to my Github page!

I am from Curitiba, Brazil and currently living in Pesaro, Italy.

I have a degree in History and Public Administration. I'm a very curious person! After working for 12 years with contracts and biddings in the public administration, I made a career transition 6 months ago and I've started working as web developer, loving this new world so far!
<br>
My passions are: hiking, reading and astronomy.
