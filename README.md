### Welcome to my Github page!

I'm from Curitiba, a beautiful city in Brazil, but currently, I'm living in the eternal city of Rome, Italy. It's an incredible place to be, with so much history, culture, and delicious food!<br>
I have a diverse background in History and Public Administration, which has given me a unique perspective on the world. However, after working in the Brazilian public administration for several years, I realized that I was looking for a new challenge. That's when I decided to make a career transition and become a full-stack developer. It's been two years since then, and I have to say, I'm really enjoying it! I love the creative problem-solving that comes with being a developer, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills. <br>
My passions are: hiking, reading and astronomy.
