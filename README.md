Originally from Curitiba, Brazil, I now call Rome, Italy, home. <br> With a background in History and Public Administration, I made the leap to full-stack development two years ago. I thrive on creative problem-solving and constantly seek ways to enhance my skills. <br> Outside coding, you'll find me passionate about hiking, reading, and exploring the wonders of astronomy.
